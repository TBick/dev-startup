## Goal
The goal of this repo is to explore both the github environment, command line, and build a small program that can be *FINISHED*.


## Usage Examples
`dev_startup` 
Builds a standard development environment in the current directory

`dev_startup --[language]`
Builds a language specific environment in the current directory

## Future Plans
- Add support for handling better cli options and parameters
- Add support for increased control over options
- Potential configuration file creation (possible global/project specific?)
